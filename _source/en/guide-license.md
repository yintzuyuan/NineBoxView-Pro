## FAQ

### Can I use it on multiple computers?

Yes, you can use the same license key on multiple computers you own. You need to reload the license file on a new computer. The license file never expires and can be used unlimited times.

### What if I lose my license key?

> [!TIP]
> Please email [support@erikyin.net](mailto:support@erikyin.net) with the email address used for purchase, and we'll help you recover your license key.

### Where is license data stored?

License data is stored on your computer. When online, only license validity is verified—no other usage data is collected. License file needs to be reloaded after reinstalling Glyphs.
